This is an implementation of a probabilistic classifier for the recognition of handwritten digits made in the course TDP015 Mathematics. The program is trained with and evaluates 70,000 images in the MNIST database of handwritten Digits. We were given the database, mnist.py and png.py as a part of the assignment. We were also given instructions in the skeleton code file that came along with the assignment. The actual code in the Han_rec.py file is written by Andrei Moga(Me) and Fredrik.

Usage:
>> python3 Han_Rec.py

The program will train and evaluate from the database automatically.
